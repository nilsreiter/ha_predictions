For example, if you want to predict the state of a light based on motion sensors and time of day, you would select motion sensors and a time-based entity as feature entities. It may help to reduce the resolution of time-based entities by providing a template sensor that only contains the first digit of minutes (e.g., 10:15 becomes 10:1)."
